# Lexin

> I've made this app for my wife to facilitate learning and maintaing her Swedish language.

It's a light-weight application for Swedish dictionary service Lexin.

There is a web-interface to the [Lexin](http://lexin2.nada.kth.se/lexin/), but it has an outdated,
and non-responsive design which makes it hard to use on mobile phone or tablet. There is also an
iOS application for this dictionary, but it's not maintained and lack of some useful features
(like it's impossible to use it in split-screen mode when reading a book, for example).
