# History Bits

Initially, I've created this app for my wife to help her to learn and maintain good level of Swedish language.

There is (was) a web interface to the [Lexin](http://lexin2.nada.kth.se/lexin/).

But it has a little bit outdated, non-responsive layout. And makes it hard to use this website on mobile phone or tablet.

We have found also a [third-party iOS application](https://apps.apple.com/se/app/lexin/id882570460) for Lexin dictionary, and it is also not well-maintained and lacks some useful features (e.g. it's impossible to use it in split-screen mode when reading a book on a tablet).

## Screenshots

One of the very first working versions of our Lexin Light application screens:

In comparison to standard Lexin website interface:

## Rename to Mobi

We decided to change initial project name from "Lexin Light" to "Lexin Mobi" to align it with the short domain name we bought: https://lexin.mobi.

In 2024, we did another micro-rebranding and renamed it to "Lexin.mobi".
